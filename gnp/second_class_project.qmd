## Project Overview

You will design and develop a **multiplayer game** using Unreal Engine. This is an individual project where you'll demonstrate your understanding of game development fundamentals, networking concepts, and Unreal Engine workflows.

## Mandatory Requirements

### Core Requirement
- **The game MUST support multiplayer functionality** (2+ players)
- Players must be able to connect and interact within the same game session

### Technical Requirements
- Built in Unreal Engine
- Functional networking implementation (listen server or dedicated server)
- Basic game loop (start, play, end conditions)
- Player input handling
- At least one win/loss condition or objective

## Project Scope

Since this is an individual project, keep your scope manageable:

- **Simple gameplay mechanics** are encouraged
- Focus on core multiplayer functionality over complex features
- 2-4 player support is sufficient
- Single level/map is acceptable

## Suggested Game Types

Consider these approaches (or create your own):

- **Competitive**: Race, deathmatch, capture the flag
- **Cooperative**: Puzzle solving, survival, team objectives
- **Party game**: Mini-games, quick rounds, simple mechanics
- **Sport/arena**: Soccer variant, tag, territory control

## Deliverables

1. **Playable Build**
   - Packaged game executable
   - Clear instructions for hosting/joining games
   
2. **Source Project**
   - Complete Unreal Engine project folder
   - Organized assets and blueprints
   
3. **Documentation** (brief)
   - Game concept and rules
   - Controls and how to play
   - Known issues or limitations
   - Credits for any external assets used

4. **Demonstration**
   - In-class playtest with working multiplayer
   - 5-minute presentation of your game

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criteria | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Multiplayer functionality works | 45% |
| Code/blueprint quality | 45% |
| Report | 10% |

## Deadline

- **27th January, 2026**: Project presentation and delivery.

## Resources

- [Unreal Engine Multiplayer Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/multiplayer-programming/)
- [Network Replication](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/replication/)
- Course materials and example projects
- Office hours for technical support

## Tips for Success

- **Start simple**: Get basic multiplayer working first, then add features
- **Test early and often**: Test with actual network connections, not just PIE
- **Use version control**: Commit your work regularly
- **Scope appropriately**: Better to have a simple, polished game than complex, broken one
- **Ask for help**: Don't wait until the last minute if you're stuck

## Academic Integrity

- You may use marketplace assets (free or paid) - cite them in documentation
- You may reference tutorials and documentation
- All code/blueprints must be your own work or properly attributed
- Collaboration on concepts is fine, but implementations must be individual
