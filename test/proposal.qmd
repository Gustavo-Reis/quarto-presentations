## High-Level Overview

### What We Understood

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Your Operation:**

- 335 tons/day processing capacity
- 1.5-2 million cans per day
- 1,800 employees
- Two production methods: Raw Pack & Pre-Cook
- 12,000 tons cold storage
- 95% export to EU
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Two Distinct Streams:**

- **Raw Pack:** Direct filling, single cook
- **Pre-Cook:** Cook first, then fill
- Different recovery rates
- Different bottlenecks
- Different product types
:::
:::

**Question for you:** Is this correct? Are there other aspects we should understand?

## Raw Pack Process

### Our Understanding

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Process Steps:**

1. Thawing (163 t/d capacity)
2. Raw butchering/cutting
3. Direct filling into cans
4. Adding liquid (oil/brine/water)
5. Seaming
6. Sterilization (cooking in-can)
7. Labeling & packing

**Key Equipment:**

- Marleen pump fillers
- CFT seamers
- Speed: 200-350 cans/min
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**What We Calculated:**

- Recovery rate: 62%
- Can sizes: 80g to 400g
- Operating hours: 20 hrs/day
- Efficiency: 75%

**Apparent Bottleneck:**

- Thawing capacity: 163 t/d
- This seems to limit RP throughput
:::
:::

**Questions:** Is 62% recovery accurate? Is thawing indeed your constraint?

---

## Pre-Cook Process

### Our Understanding

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Process Steps:**

1. Racking (252 t/d capacity)
2. Pre-cooking in 7 cookers (315 t/d)
3. Extractor cooling (429 t/d)
4. Further cooling (447 t/d)
5. **Cleaning tables** (251 t/d)
6. Filling cooked meat
7. Seaming
8. Final sterilization
9. Labeling & packing

**Products:** Chunk, Flakes, Steak
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
**What We Calculated:**

- Recovery rate: 45%
- 9 production lines
- 200+ cleaners across 9 tables
- Productivity: 53 kg/cleaner/hr

**Apparent Bottleneck:**

- Cleaning capacity: 251 t/d
- Most labor-intensive step
:::
:::

**Questions:** Is cleaning the real constraint? What drives the 45% recovery?

---

## Key Finding #1: Recovery Rate Gap

### 17 Percentage Point Difference

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Raw Pack: 62%
- Fish cooked in can
- Retains natural oils
- Less handling
- Minimal waste before canning

**From 100 tons raw fish:**
→ 62 tons finished product
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Pre-Cook: 45%
- Pre-cooked before canning
- Skin, bones removed manually
- More processing steps
- Higher waste generation

**From 100 tons raw fish:**
→ 45 tons finished product
:::
:::

**Questions for you:**

- Is this recovery difference accurate?
- What drives the PC losses? (skin/bones/dark meat/oils?)
- Is there room for improvement in either process?

---

## Key Finding #2: Bottlenecks

### Critical Constraints We Identified

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Raw Pack Bottleneck
**Thawing: 163 tons/day**

- 160 tanks available
- 14-hour thaw time
- 85% efficiency
- Limits entire RP stream

**Impact:**

- Even though sorting can handle 4,080 t/d
- Thawing limits RP to ~163 t/d
- Rest of RP line underutilized?
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Pre-Cook Bottleneck
**Cleaning: 251 tons/day**

- 9 cleaning tables
- ~200 workers
- 21 hours/day operation
- Manual, labor-intensive

**Impact:**

- Pre-cookers can handle 315 t/d
- Cleaning limits PC to ~251 t/d
- Creates workforce dependency
:::
:::

**Questions:** Do you experience these as bottlenecks? What do you see as your main constraints?

---

## Key Finding #3: Capacity Utilization

### Theoretical vs. Actual

| Stream | Bottleneck Capacity | Your Stated Capacity | Gap |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Raw Pack** | 163 t/d (thawing limit) | Part of 335 t/d | ? |
| **Pre-Cook** | 251 t/d (cleaning limit) | Part of 335 t/d | ? |
| **Combined** | 414 t/d theoretical | **335 t/d actual** | **79 t/d (19%)** |

**Our Interpretation:**

- You're running at ~81% of theoretical maximum
- Either production mix constraints, or
- Scheduling/planning challenges, or
- Other factors we haven't identified

**Questions:** 

- How do you split production between RP and PC daily?
- What prevents you from reaching 414 t/d?
- Are there other constraints we're missing?

---

## Equipment Observations

### What We Noticed

::: {.columns}

::: {.column}
**Pre-Cook Cookers (7 units):**

- Combined capacity: 315 t/d
- **Above** the cleaning capacity (251 t/d)
- Suggests cookers may not be fully utilized?
:::

::: {.column}

**Cooling Chambers:**

- Extractor: 429 t/d capacity
- Cooling: 447 t/d capacity  
- **Well above** cleaning capacity
- Significant excess capacity here

:::

::: {.column}

**Cleaning Tables (9 tables):**

- Capacity: 251 t/d
- Operating: 21 hours/day
- Already near maximum utilization
- Limited room for improvement without changes

:::
:::

**Question:** Are cookers and cooling chambers often idle waiting for cleaning?

---

## Filling & Seaming

### Different Approaches

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Raw Pack
- **Marleen pump fillers**

- **CFT seamers**

- Handles raw fish pieces
- Variable fill weights (0.06-0.32 kg)
- Speed: 200-350 cans/min
- Filling happens before any cooking
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Pre-Cook  
- Multiple filler systems
- 9 different production lines
- Handles cooked, cleaned loins
- Smaller fill weights (0.05-0.10 kg)
- Speed: 180-500 cans/min
- Line 1 fastest (500 cpm)
:::
:::

**Questions:**

- Do filler speeds vary by product type?
- Are certain lines preferred for certain products?
- Any reliability issues with specific equipment?

---

## Sterilization Differences

### Interesting Observation

| Product Type | Temperature | Time | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|------|-------|
| **Raw Pack** | 121°C | 41-80 min | Higher temp, longer time |
| **Pre-Cook** | 117°C | 47-72 min | Lower temp (already cooked) |

**Our Interpretation:**

- RP needs full cooking in-can (raw → cooked)
- PC needs only sterilization (already cooked)

**Questions:**

- Is this interpretation correct?

---

## Labeling Complexity

### 10 Different Lines

**What we observed:**

- Line 1: High-speed clustering and shrinking
- Lines 2A/2B: Multi-pack configurations
- Line 3: Manual and automated hybrid
- Lines 4-9: Specialized configurations
- Line 10: Bulk packing

**Efficiency:** 83% across all lines

**Many different pack formats:**

- 2-pack, 3-pack, 4-pack, 5-pack, 6-pack, 7-pack, 8-pack, 12-pack, 24-pack, 48-pack, bulk

**Questions:**

- How do you decide which line for which product?
- Is line allocation optimized or manual scheduling?
- Do changeovers cause significant downtime?

---

## Production Scheduling

### What We're Curious About

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Current Process (our assumption):**

- Manual planning and scheduling?
- Decisions based on:
  - Customer orders
  - Fish availability by size
  - Line availability
  - Workforce scheduling

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Complexity Factors:**

- Two completely different production streams
- Multiple can sizes and pack formats
- Bottlenecks at different stages
- 10 different labeling lines
- Variable demand by product/market

:::

:::

**Questions:**

- How do you plan daily production?
- How far in advance do you schedule?
- What are the biggest scheduling challenges?
- How do you handle rush orders or changes?

---
